  description: |
    Python Fire is a simple way to create a CLI in Python. Python Fire is a helpful tool for developing and debugging Python code. Python Fire helps with exploring existing code or turning other people's code into a CLI. Python Fire makes transitioning between Bash and Python easier. Python Fire makes using a Python REPL easier by setting up the REPL with the modules and variables you'll need already imported and created.
