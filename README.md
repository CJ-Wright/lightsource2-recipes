# Instructions for building the master branch of our stack

1. log in to whatever machine you want to build the dev stack on

 - I am building on xf23id1-srv2. Thanks @stuwilkins!

2. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ericdill/conda-build-utils/master/scripts/init-for-conda-build.sh`

3. `bash init-for-conda-build.sh`

 - You will probably have to type in your sudo password so you can create the
   ramdisk in /tmp on whatever machine you are on

4. export your binstar token to the environmental variable BINSTAR_TOKEN

 - This token can be generated by `anaconda auth --create --name conda-builder --scopes "all"`
 - you can export this token in your .bashrc

5. execute the file "dev-build": `bash dev-build`

6. Go get a coffee and celebrate.
